          <h1>Welcome to Harri Vaelilae's developing blog</h1>
          <p>Hi, this is Harri. Desinging and developing of this website is one man show and therefore slow paced one. It will be showcasing some of my coding projects and sharing the ideas and thoughs of different coding techniques.  </p>
          <p>I am in the middle of carrier change so making the updates here will be not that frequent, but essential part for me in order to level up my game in the world of developing and becoming "fulltime" software developer.</p>
          <p>I will be making changes on techniques the site funtions and try my best to describe what's changed and why something is made like I have done it</p>
          <p>Thanks for reading and joining my journey into the depths of the software development</p>
          <p>And... yes as of today the site and this Blog page is just static website. I know all this would be so so easily done with website builders like wordpress or WIX, but what's the fun in that!</p>
